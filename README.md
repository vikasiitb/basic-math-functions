# basic-math-functions

Just starting out with trying out simple 

1) Addition
2) Subtraction
3) Multiplication
4) Modulus

To add, type "A" or "A)" or "(A)" or entire string "A) Addition"
To subtract type "B" or "B)" or "(B)" or entire string "B) Addition"
To multiply type "C" or "C)" or "(C)" or entire string "C) Addition"
To get modulus type "D" or "D)" or "(D)" or entire string "D) Addition"

Next stuff
- Add loop for entering infinite numbers
- Ask for math operation between the two numbers entered
- Impose BODMAS rules for final calculation
- Use tkinter for GUI and history for long operations
